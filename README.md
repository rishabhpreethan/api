# NOTES

> curl
* used to send data back and forth locally

##### If an endpoint contains {} then the value in it has to be replaced
* eg:
>https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/{user_id}/playlists
- here the user id is in {}
- so it has to be replaced with the user id which in my case is
>https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/8c3sgu4skz19vetw8pz7512r0/playlists
